       ------
Prerequisites:
=> Make sure your system (both puppet server and client) is able to resolve the hostname each other, 
   either use /etc/hosts file or DNS

-Run it on both master and agent nodes:
#rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-el-7.noarch.rpm

-Install puppetserver on master node
#yum install puppet-server 
#vi /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
	
	[main]
	dns_alt_names = master,master.host.local
	certname = master.host.local

-run below command to create the puppet master certificate.

#puppet master --verbose --no-daemonize

-Once you get “Notice: Starting Puppet master version <VERSION>“, 
 press ctrl-C to kill the process

-On your client machine, install puppet agent using below command.
#yum -y install puppet
#vi /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

	[agent]
	server = master.host.local

-Make sure puppetmaster is up(login to master #service puppetmaster start) 

#systemctl start  puppet.service
#systemctl enable puppet.service


-Sign the Agent Node’s Certificate on Master Server:

In master:

#puppet cert list

"client.host.local" (SHA256) D4:88:EC:C5:0A:F7:5D:4E:32

#puppet cert sign client.host.local

-now run the following command from agent node
#puppet agent -t
