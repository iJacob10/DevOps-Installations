INSTALLING INTELLIJ
----------------------

Download Intellij for Linux from the jetbrains website. You can download this with your browser:

https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=linux&code=IIC


copy tar file to /opt/directory

chown -R root:root /opt/rea*

ln -s /opt/idea-IC-163.10154.41/bin/idea.sh /usr/local/bin/idea.sh

 idea.sh


Note: Version Intellij 15 shows error message: “IBus prior to 1.5.11 may cause input problems. See IDEA-78860 for details.” It doesn’t seem to cause me any problems.  You can click the link: “Do not show again.”
